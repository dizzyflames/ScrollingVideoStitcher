# ScrollingVideoStitcher
You know how some webtoons/manhuas are translated on youtube first and for some
reason the good translations never make it to the other manga sites? Well this is what I made this program for, 
a simple program but it works as long as you can figure out the frame interval to stitch together.

Takes a youtube video and stitches frames together vertically, I use this to read webtoons/manhuas on youtube

I figured this was enough and I didn't need to do anything too complicated because the scrolling speed tends to be pretty consistent throughout the video.
